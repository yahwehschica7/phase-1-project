# McCormick Investigations Webpage

McCormick Investigations is a single page application (SPA) created to showcase my fictional character's private detective business. The page includes a contact form, a picture of the lost cat Rachel McCormick is taking care of, and images of the FBI's Most Wanted that a page visitor can look at using next and previous buttons. 

## Links Used

Used CSS from materialize (https://materializecss.com/) to create the color and style of the page. This is found in the html file.
The picture of the cat is pulled from https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aD1n89B_460s.jpg. This link is located in the js file. 
The images of wanted criminals is pulled from a public API located at https://api.fbi.gov/@wanted. The api link is found in the js file.
